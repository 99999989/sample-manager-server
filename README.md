# Sample Manager Server

The sample manager server is a server application crafted with (Node.js)[nodejs.com] and (Express)[expressjs.com] using (Mongoose)[mongoosejs.com] for modeling. I create this server application in order of my bachelor thesis in business informatics at the ZHAW , which targets to support experience sampling projects in their management and (non-invasive) execution.
