# Sample Manager Server

The sample manager server is a server application crafted with [Node.js](http://nodejs.com) and [Express](http://expressjs.com) using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) for modeling. I create this server application in order of my bachelor thesis in business informatics at the ZHAW, which targets to support experience sampling projects in their management and (non-invasive) execution.
